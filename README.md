## Random Password Generator

### Motivation

This project is a simple JavaScript application that generates random passwords based on user preferences. The user can specify the length of the password, and whether it should contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

### Why this was built

This application was built to provide a simple and user-friendly way to generate secure passwords. It's important to have complex and unique passwords for each of your online accounts, and this tool makes it easy to create them.

### What it solved

This application solves the problem of creating secure, complex passwords. It eliminates the need for the user to come up with a password on their own, which can often lead to using insecure or repetitive passwords.

### What I learned

Through building this application, I learned about the importance of password security and how to use JavaScript to interact with the user through prompts and generate random strings.
